# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is my Rock Paper Scissors project for The Odin Project.

This is a JavaScript implementation of the popular Rock Paper Scissor game. 
In this first implementation, we will only create the JavaScript logic accessible via the browser console.
In this project I will practice:
- Pseudocode
- Javascript
- Error handling
